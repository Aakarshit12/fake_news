# Fake News Detection

Fake News Detection is a machine learning project that classifies news articles or social media content as **Real** or **Fake** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning techniques. The project demonstrates text preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation within a structured experimental workflow.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

With the rapid spread of misinformation online, automated fake news detection systems are essential. This project explores how neural networks and NLP techniques can identify misleading or fabricated news content efficiently and accurately.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

* Text cleaning and preprocessing
* Tokenization and vectorization
* CNN-based text classification model
* Model training and evaluation
* Performance analysis using classification metrics
* Inference on new/unseen text samples

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* Python
* NumPy & Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* TensorFlow / Keras
* NLTK (for preprocessing)
* Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📂 Repository Structure

```

## ⚙️ How to Run the Project

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/Aakarshit12/fake_news.git
cd fake_news
```

### 2️⃣ Install dependencies

```
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn tensorflow nltk matplotlib
```

### 3️⃣ Run the notebook

```
jupyter notebook fake_news_detection.ipynb
```

Execute all cells to:

* Load dataset
* Preprocess text
* Train the model
* Evaluate performance
* Generate predictions

---

## 📊 Model Overview

The model uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for text classification. The workflow includes:

1. Text normalization and stopword removal
2. Tokenization and sequence padding
3. Embedding layer for semantic representation
4. Convolution + pooling layers for feature extraction
5. Dense layers for classification

---

## 📈 Results

The model is evaluated using accuracy and classification metrics. Performance improvements include:

* Reduction in false positives
* Improved classification speed
* Optimized preprocessing pipeline

(Exact metrics can be updated here based on final evaluation.)
